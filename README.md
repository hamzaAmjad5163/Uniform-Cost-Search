# Uniform-Cost-Search-Python
Uniform-Cost Search is similar to Dijikstraâ€™s algorithm . In this algorithm from the starting state we will visit the adjacent states and will choose the least costly state then we will choose the next least costly state from the all un-visited and adjacent states of the visited states, in this way we will try to reach the goal state (note we wont continue the path through a goal state ), even if we reach the goal state we will continue searching for other possible paths( if there are multiple goals) . We will keep a priority queue which will give the least costliest next state from all the adjacent states of visited states.
